# Private Dotfiles

**DO NOT PUSH PRIVATE DATA TO GITHUB**


Put this repo in the same parent directory as my dotfiles repo, and it will automatically be installed.  This repo is meant for your private API tokens, SSH configurations, work-specific configs, and anything that should not be shared with others.  By keeping a repo like this in your Dropbox, your personal settings can follow you from computer to computer.
